# Concept Scripts

These are primarily intended as example scripts.

## Binary Search Cat 
`Binary Search cat.sb3` is a scratch program with a cat, that will guess an integer of your choice between 1 and 100 using the binary search algorithm. This requires Scratch to run. See https://scratch.mit.edu/ to run Scratch in your browser, or obtain it for offline use (https://scratch.mit.edu/download).

## Dr Nim - Original Gameplay with coloured text
`doctor_nim_original_color.py` is a script to reproduce the gameplay of Dr. Nim as sold in the 1960s. Note that the computer player always wins on this version.
Requires Python3 to run (https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

This may be run from the command line as `python doctor_nim_original_color.py` when set to the directory in which the file is saved.

## Memory-efficient 100 Doors (Python)
`efficient.py` is a script that solves the 100 doors problem using bitwise arithmetic. Runs with 100 (the classic value) by default, but accepts a command line value that over-rides the count of 100 doors. The efficiency is achieved by using 1 bit or the equivalent to represent each door (Boolean types may use at least one byte).
